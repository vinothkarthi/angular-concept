<h3>Life cycle hooks</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    ngOnchanges() = when an "&#64;"Input() value changes (before ngOnInit on
    first run). if there are no "&#64;"Input() properties, this method will not
    be called. if the "&#64;"Input() is an object or array, this method will be
    called only when the reference changes (not when a property inside the
    object/array changes).
    <b>Good for: reacting to input changes.</b>
  </li>
  <li>
    ngOnInit() = once, after the first ngOnChanges(). "&#64;"viewChild and
    "&#64;"ContentChild are set after this runs.
    <b>Good for: component initialization, fetching initial data.</b>
  </li>
  <li>
    ngDoCheck() = every change detection cycle (after ngOnChanges and ngOnInit).
    Runs very frequently, so avoid heavy work here.
    <b>Good for: custom change detection.</b>
  </li>
  <li>
    ngAfterContentInit() = once, after projecting external content into the
    component (after the first ngDoCheck). "&#64;"ContentChild,
    "&#64;"contentChildren are set just before this runs. It will run only once,
    after that if content projection changes, it will not run again. It is only
    component hook, not directive hook.
    <b>Good for: initializing things that depend on projected content.</b>
  </li>
  <li>
    ngAfterContentChecked() = every change detection cycle after
    ngAfterContentInit. Runs very frequently, so avoid heavy work here.
    "&#64;"ContentChild, "&#64;"contentChildren changes are update just before
    this runs. It is only component hook, not directive hook.
    <b>Good for: reacting to projected content changes.</b>
  </li>
  <li>
    ngAfterViewInit() = once, after the component's view (and child component
    and directive views) are initialized (after the first
    ngAfterContentChecked). "&#64;"ViewChild, "&#64;"viewChildren are set just
    before this runs. It will run only once, after that if the view changes, it
    will not run again. It is only component hook, not directive hook.
    <b>Good for: initializing things that depend on the component's view.</b>
  </li>
  <li>
    ngAfterViewChecked() = every change detection cycle after ngAfterViewInit.
    Runs very frequently, so avoid heavy work here. "&#64;"ViewChild,
    "&#64;"viewChildren changes are update just before this runs. It is only
    component hook, not directive hook.
    <b>Good for: reacting to view changes.</b>
  </li>
  <li>
    ngOnDestroy() = once, just before the component/directive is destroyed.
    <b
      >Good for: cleanup like unsubscribing from observables, detaching event
      handlers to avoid memory leaks.</b
    >
  </li>
  <li>
    afterRender() = every render cycle (like ngAfterViewChecked but for DOM).
    Runs after every DOM paint — if Angular changes the template again, it will
    run again.
    <b
      >Good for: recalculating positions, measuring elements, syncing with
      animations.</b
    >
  </li>
  <li>
    afterNextRender() = once, after the next render cycle (like ngAfterViewInit
    but for DOM). Runs once, after the first DOM paint — if Angular changes the
    template again, it will NOT run again.
    <b
      >Good for: one-time setup that needs the DOM, like initializing a
      third-party library.</b
    >
  </li>
