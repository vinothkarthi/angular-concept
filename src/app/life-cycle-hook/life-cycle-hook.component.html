1. afterRender() = every render cycle (like ngAfterViewChecked but for DOM).
Runs after every DOM paint — if Angular changes the template again, it will run
again. Good for: recalculating positions, measuring elements, syncing with
animations.
<br />
2. afterNextRender() = once, after the next render cycle (like ngAfterViewInit
but for DOM). Runs once, after the first DOM paint — if Angular changes the
template again, it will NOT run again. Good for: one-time setup that needs the
DOM, like initializing a third-party library.
